# Agentic AI Simulation

This Python-based simulation models goal-directed agentic AI systems with varying levels of autonomy, knowledge, communication ability, and trust dynamics over time. The model simulates three agents responding to environmental complexity, goal misalignment, and human trust feedback.

## Features

- Agent-specific traits: Risk tolerance & communication ability
- Dynamics of goal progress, knowledge gain, and autonomy adjustment
- Human trust feedback loop based on agent performance
- Events: task switching and goal misalignment
- High-resolution annotated visual output

## Requirements

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the simulation:
```bash
python agentic_ai_simulation.py
```

## Output

- `Agentic_AI_Simulation_Full_Code.png`: High-resolution annotated chart
